Not entirely sure what this will end up being.. but for the meantime I will use it as library to automate some computations 
broadly related to magnetic quivers.


Some things I implemented
- unitary quiver subtraction algorithm to create Hasse diagrams
- calculating intersection numbers of subwebs in brane webs (needs redoing)

Some things I imagine could be added as well
- quiver -> brane system
- finding possible subwebs
- subweb decomposition -> magnetic quiver
- read global symmetry from magnetic quiver






Possible optimisations: ending branes on the proper 7-branes not just at the next one to come.... not entirely sure if this makes things easier or not, in some ways definitely easier...
