Tools to automate some computations when working with magnetic quivers.

unitary_quivers computes hasse diagrams via quiver subtraction of unitary magnetic quivers.

todo:
- quiver -> brane system
- finding possible subwebs
- subweb decomposition -> magnetic quiver
- read global symmetry from magnetic quiver
