Library to automate some computations broadly related to magnetic quivers. E.g.
- Finding magnetic quivers from brane webs / electric quivers
- Finding Hasse diagrams of moduli spaces from magnetic quivers via quiver subtraction


Some things I imagine could be added as well
- automatically read global symmetry from magnetic quiver
